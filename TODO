load information on homepage from database (registration time, game time, etc.)
tidy repository with dynamic content (download directory submodule, now missing problems from 2012-2)
design better editing of team after registration deadline (due to fixing category of the team)
	- is category speculation real issue?
display current Prague time before start of game (to sync teams in different TZ)

separate organizers access
	- communication
	- registration
	- unfreezed statistics
better communication channel than forum
automated event notifications
	- begin of hurry-up
	- task solved by teammate at different computer
	- (consider server load)
better layout of detailed statistics table
allow running game in instances per user (aka single user mode :-)
	- only passed games, training
do not freeze statistics of tasks
