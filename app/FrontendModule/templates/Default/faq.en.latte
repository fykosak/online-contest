<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    Yes but only until the end of the registration period.

<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    Yes but only until the end of the registration period.

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">
Can I change the name of the team after creating it?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    Yes but only until the end of the registration period.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">
Can I take part even if I am not a high school student?

<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    Yes. The Open category is for you. More in the rules.
</div><br />

</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    Yes. But you must expect that you will be in the same category as the most junior highschool students. You can find more in the rules.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">Can a foreigner take part?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    Yes. But unless he is a part of a Czech or Slovak team he must compete in a different category. Of course a huge advantage for them would be if they knew English or Czech.
</div><br />

<h2 id="game">The Competition itself</h2>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">We will we able to communicate with the organizers? If so how and in what languages?</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    Yes, during the competition we will give out important information through our noticeboard that will be available on our website. Send your questions about the tasks and other things to <a href="mailto:online@fyziklani.cz">online@fyziklani.cz</a>. 
    You can cheer each other on using our forum. You can communicate in Czech (or Slovak) and English (but only for the foreign high schoolers and the Open category.).
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">
Can I use the internet to find information during the competition?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    Yes but you can't communicate with non-members of your team.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">What are the phases of the competition?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    The competition has two main phases and one supplementary one (Hurry-up). The first phase starts with the competition and sometime during its duration the Hurry-up phase will begin. These will then run in parallel until the start of the second phase. The second phase links to the first and the only difference is that you can skip problems in it. For the Hurry-up phase see the rules and the questions and answers below.
</div><br />

<h2 id="tasks">Problems</h2>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">In what language will the problems be?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    In Czech and English.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">When and how will we get new problems to solve during the competition?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    You will get the seven initial problems when the competition starts. You can expect new problems with the Hurry-up series. During the competition you must solve the problems you have to get new ones or, in the second phase, by skipping problems. The exchange is always one for one. You can find more information in the rules.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">
How does the difficulty of the problem change with its number?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    The average difficulty rises as you do the problems but there still might be some easier problems later on. Also, remember that difficulty is highly individual.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">
Will we get author's solutions?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    Yes, after the end of the competition the solutions will appear on our website. Some time after the end the organizers will still be on the website and will be reacting to your recommendations, experiences or troubles relating the competition or the problems.
</div><br />



<h2 id="submits">Submitting solutions</h2>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">How many significant figures should one give in the solution?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    The task should make it clear. If it isn't clear then contact the organizers. In general it is true that more significant figures are not a problem.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">The task doesn't tell us which units to submit the result in. What should we do?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
   If it is so then just submit it in the base SI units.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">
We want to submit the answer to the problem but we can't. What is going on?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    The reason must be that you submitted a wrong solution to a task less than a minute ago. If it isn't so then please contact the organizers.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">If I submit the wrong answer can I correct it?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    Yes, you can answer any question as many times as you want to. Remember though that by submitting wrong answers you will lower the potential point gain from the question and also that you can't answer the problems from the same category incorrectly more than once in a minute (the problems from the main category and the three hurry-up categories). For more information see the rules of the competition.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">If we want to submit the solution as a decimal should we use a decimal point or comma?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    The symbol is irrelevant but don't use anything to denote thousands (i. e., use 1000000 instead of 1,000,000) .
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">
What are the accepted formats of numbers?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
  We accept the formats described on   <a href='http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.float.php'>http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.float.php</a> 
   and we enable the usage of both the comma and the decimal point.
</div><br />

<h2 id="skipping">Skipping problems</h2>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">
When can I skip a problem?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    You can skip problems in the second part of the competition (from 18:30 CET).
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">
Will I lose points for skipping problems?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    Yes, you will lose one point per skipped problem from your total score.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">
How many problems can I skip?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    You can skip as many problems as you want to but you have to have a sufficient amount of points. You can't skip another problem if it would bring you below -7 points. If this happens to you then know that you can start skipping problems again once you have more than -7 points.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">
Can I come back to a problem I skipped?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    No.</div><br />


<h2 id="scoring">Points</h2>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">
How do we get bonus points?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    You can get bonus points for solving a whole collection of Hurry-up problems. 
    More about this in the rules.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}"> We got Y points for a problem that was supposed to be worth X points. What happened?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
  This is caused by the fact that wrong solutions decrease the point gain from that problem. To get more information about this look at the rules.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">
We solved the problem but this hasn't appeared on the scoreboard yet. How come?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    The scoreboard refreshes every two minutes so wait a bit longer. Also remember that twenty minutes before the end of the competition the scoreboard stops refreshing completely to add extra tension.</div><br />

<h2 id="hurry-up">Hurry-up</h2>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">What is Hurry-up?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    It is a period in the competition between 18:00 and 18:30 CET when you can solve new and relatively easy problems. It is a series of problems that runs in parallel to the normal competition. The Hurry-up series has some specific rules though. You can find more about this in the rule section. 
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">
Can I submit solutions to the normal problems during this part of the competition?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    Yes.</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">How will I find out that the Hurry-up series has begun?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    Using a clock. It will also be announced on the noticeboard. You should also have new problems to solve &mdash;  but to see that refreshing the page will be necessary.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">
Is the awarding of points during the Hurry-up series governed by the same rules as the standard part of the competition?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    No. Wrong answers to a given problem in the Hurry-up series will lower the potential point gain by exactly one point until you reach zero. You can't get negative points from these problems.
</div><br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq{$i}">When can I be solving the problems from the Hurry-up part of the competition?
</a>
<div id="faq{$i++}" class="collapse">
    From 18:00 till 18:30 CET, after that we won't be accepting any more solutions to the Hurry-up problems.
</div><br />
